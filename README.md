# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors

An interactive, browser-based version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. This project focuses on JavaScript logic, event listeners, and dynamic UI updates.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Select your weapon: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer will make a random choice.
3. The winner of the round is declared, and the score updates automatically.
4. First to 5 points wins the game!

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Scoring:** Real-time score tracking using JavaScript variables.
* **Interactive UI:** Buttons change state and trigger animations on click.
* **Win/Loss Logic:** Robust conditional logic to determine the winner of every round.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with CSS to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for game elements.
* **CSS3:** Custom layout, transitions, and hover effects for a modern look.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used for game logic, `Math.random()` for computer moves, and DOM manipulation to update the display without refreshing.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This was my first deep dive into "making things move" with code. I learned:
* **DOM Manipulation:** How to select HTML elements and change their text or style based on game events.
* **Event Listeners:** Handling user clicks to trigger specific functions.
* **Clean Code:** Using functions to keep the game logic organized and reusable.
* **Problem Solving:** Debugging the logic for determining round winners and stopping the game once someone reaches 5 points.
